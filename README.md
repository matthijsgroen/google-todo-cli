# Google Todo cli

Command line app to manage your TODO lists. Ideal when working in a TMUX setup
and you want a todo list next to your editor and tests ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

`yarn global add google-todo-cli`

`todo-list`

And follow the instructions.

I use the task setup from the API example of Google, so the app is not
'verified'. Since its a major hassle to arrange that, I will not verify it
either.

## Usage

`todo-list`

## Keys:

- `j/k`/arrows - move selection
- `g/G` - top/bottom of list
- `1/2` - previous/next list
- `3` - refresh list
- `esc/Ctrl-c` - quit
- Enter - edit item
- `A` - add item underneath selected item
- `D` - Delete task (hide if task is completed)
- `x` - Complete/open task
